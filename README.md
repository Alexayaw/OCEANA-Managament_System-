# Clinic Management System (University project)
## Introduction

Most of the clinic in Malaysia are still using paperwork as the primary way of recording and storing data. 
These paperwork may be cheap to implement but would slow down the overall business performance of the clinic. 

For example, it might take a long time for staff to retrieve a patient’s file that are stored in a file cabinet .
This problem can be avoided if clinic implement clinic management system that can systematically record and store data in an efficient way. 

By integrating this information system into the clinic, nurse will not need to fill up tedious
amount of patient’s information on the paper form manually but could just type and store the data into the system in just a few minutes. 

This could keep human error to a minimum and this in turn, from a business perspective, could help to reduce cost and saves time since less time are spent on fixing errors but more on focusing how to deliver the best service to the patients. 
Therefore, the purpose of this project is to develop an information system called- OCEANA clinic management system to facilitate the daily operations of the OCEANA clinic. 

It aims to help staff in OCEANA clinic which includes admin, staff, and doctor to do their job more efficiently.
